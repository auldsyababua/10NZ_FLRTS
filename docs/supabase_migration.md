# 10NetZero-FLRTS Supabase Database Migration

## Overview

This document provides details about the successful implementation of the PostgreSQL schema for the 10NetZero-FLRTS system in Supabase. The schema follows the specifications outlined in `noloco_appendix_a.md` and includes all required tables, relationships, business logic, and optimizations.

## Files Description

The implementation consists of several files:

1. **supabase_schema_fixed.sql**
   - Core database schema with tables, indexes, and basic functions
   - Includes table definitions for all master data, relationships, financial, equipment, and operational tables
   - Uses correct table creation ordering to satisfy foreign key dependencies
   - Contains basic markup management logic

2. **supabase_schema_update.sql**
   - Additional enhancements and business logic
   - Adds markup change logging table and auditing
   - Implements enhanced trigger functions
   - Adds financial reporting functions and views

3. **supabase_sample_data_upsert.sql**
   - Contains sample data for testing the schema with ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING clauses
   - Provides examples for all key tables
   - Demonstrates markup management workflow
   - Includes proper constraint handling for vendor categories

4. **execute_psql.sh**
   - Bash script for direct PostgreSQL execution
   - Connects directly to Supabase PostgreSQL database
   - Applies schema, updates, and sample data
   - Provides detailed execution feedback

## Key Features Implemented

### Database Organization

- **Master Data Tables**: sites, partners, vendors, personnel, operators, flrts_users
- **Relationship Tables**: site_partner_assignments, site_vendor_assignments
- **Financial Tables**: vendor_invoices, partner_billings
- **Equipment Tables**: equipment, asics, licenses_agreements
- **FLRTS Operational Tables**: field_reports, lists, tasks, reminders, notifications_log

### Markup Manager Business Logic

The markup management system handles:

1. **Automatic markup calculation** based on site-partner relationships
2. **Partner billing generation** from vendor invoices
3. **Audit logging** for markup percentage changes
4. **Special handling** for paid invoices
5. **Financial reporting functions** for partners and sites

### Performance Optimization

- Strategic **indexes** on commonly queried columns
- **Generated columns** for frequently used combinations (e.g., full_name, full_address)
- **Database views** for common query patterns

### Security Implementation

- **Row-level security policies** for controlling access to data
- **Role-based access control** with app_admin, app_site_manager, etc.

## Migration Details

### Connection Information

The database schema has been successfully deployed to:

```
Host: db.thnwlykidzhrsagyjncc.supabase.co
Port: 5432
Database: postgres
User: postgres
```

### Migration Method Used

The migration was performed using direct PostgreSQL connection with `execute_psql.sh`, which provides the following advantages:

1. Direct connection to the database without API limitations
2. Full PostgreSQL functionality including functions and triggers
3. Detailed error reporting and execution feedback
4. Script idempotency with schema existence checks

### Script Execution

The script was run with:

```bash
chmod +x execute_psql.sh
./execute_psql.sh
```

This performed the following operations:

1. Connected to the Supabase PostgreSQL database
2. Created all tables with proper relationships and constraints
3. Added indexes for performance optimization
4. Implemented business logic with functions and triggers
5. Loaded sample data with conflict handling

## Verification

The implementation has been successfully verified with:

1. **Schema Verification**:
   - All tables created correctly with proper relationships
   - Functions and triggers properly deployed
   - Sample data loaded and markup calculations applied

2. **Query Testing**:
   ```sql
   -- Check tables
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

   -- Check sample data
   SELECT * FROM operators;
   SELECT * FROM sites;
   SELECT * FROM vendors;

   -- Check markup calculations
   SELECT * FROM vendor_invoices;
   ```

3. **Business Logic Verification**:
   - The recalculate_all_markups() function successfully processed 4 invoices
   - Markup calculations applied correctly to vendor invoices
   - Partner billings created successfully from invoices

## Business Logic Implementation

The following business logic components are now active:

1. **Markup Calculation**:
   - Implemented in the calculate_invoice_markup() function
   - Automatically triggered when invoices are created or updated
   - Uses markup percentages from site_partner_assignments

2. **Partner Billing Generation**:
   - Implemented in the create_partner_billing() function
   - Creates or updates partner billing records based on invoices
   - Preserves paid status when updates occur

3. **Financial Reporting**:
   - get_partner_financial_summary() provides partner financial status
   - get_site_financial_summary() provides site financial metrics
   - outstanding_partner_billings view shows billings requiring action

4. **Audit Logging**:
   - markup_changes_log table records all markup percentage changes
   - Captures old and new values, change timestamp, and user information

## Troubleshooting & Maintenance

For ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting:

1. **Schema Updates**:
   - Use the execute_psql.sh script with updated SQL files
   - Schema files include IF NOT EXISTS clauses for safe reruns

2. **Data Verification**:
   - Run recalculate_all_markups() to verify markup values
   - Check outstanding_partner_billings view for payment status

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Monitor query performance as data volume grows
   - Add additional indexes if performance issues arise
