# 10NetZero-FLRTS Database Implementation Audit Request

## Overview

This document requests an audit of the 10NetZero-FLRTS Supabase PostgreSQL implementation against the specifications in the System Design Document (SDD) and Appendix A. The database has been implemented and needs verification for completeness, correctness, and alignment with requirements.

## Audit Steps

Please follow these steps to conduct a thorough audit:

### 1. Review Documentation

First, familiarize yourself with the system requirements and specifications:

- Read `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/projects/10NZ_FLRTS/system_design_doc.md` for overall system architecture
- Study `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/projects/10NZ_FLRTS/noloco_appendix_a.md` in detail for database schema requirements
- Review `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/projects/10NZ_FLRTS/supabase_migration.md` to understand the implementation approach
- Read `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/projects/10NZ_FLRTS/relevant_documentation_updated.md` for official documentation references
- Study `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/projects/10NZ_FLRTS/implementation_guide_updated.md` for implementation details
- Review `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/projects/10NZ_FLRTS/AI_Collaboration_Guide_Updated.md` for project standards

### 2. Examine Implementation Files

Review the actual implementation files:

- `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/projects/10NZ_FLRTS/supabase_schema_fixed.sql`: Main schema definition
- `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/projects/10NZ_FLRTS/supabase_schema_update.sql`: Business logic implementation
- `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/projects/10NZ_FLRTS/supabase_sample_data_upsert.sql`: Sample data for testing
- `/Users/colinaulds/Desktop/projects/10NZ_FLRTS/execute_psql.sh`: Script used for implementation

### 3. Verify Database Structure

Connect to the Supabase PostgreSQL database and verify:

```
Host: db.thnwlykidzhrsagyjncc.supabase.co
Port: 5432
Database: postgres
User: postgres
Password: lYDPaAqABpnu6dCA
```

Conduct these checks:

1. **Table Structure Verification**:
   - Confirm all tables specified in Appendix A exist
   - Verify column data types match specifications
   - Check constraints, primary keys, and foreign keys

2. **Relationship Verification**:
   - Validate foreign key relationships match the ERD in Appendix A
   - Verify junction tables for many-to-many relationships
   - Check cascading rules for deletions

3. **Index Verification**:
   - Check that appropriate indexes exist on frequently queried columns
   - Verify composite indexes for common query patterns

### 4. Validate Business Logic

Test the implemented business functions:

1. **Markup Management**:
   - Verify `calculate_invoice_markup()` function calculates correctly
   - Test partner billing generation
   - Check triggers for markup recalculation when relationships change

2. **Financial Reporting**:
   - Test `get_partner_financial_summary()` function
   - Test `get_site_financial_summary()` function
   - Verify `outstanding_partner_billings` view shows correct information

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - Check constraints on vendor categories
   - Verify generated columns for full names and addresses
   - Test cascading updates/deletes

### 5. Performance Assessment

Evaluate performance characteristics:

1. **Indexing Effectiveness**:
   - Check EXPLAIN plans for common queries
   - Identify any missing indexes for frequent operations

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Review views and functions for efficiency
   - Check for potential bottlenecks in complex queries

### 6. Security Review

Assess database security:

1. **Row-Level Security**:
   - Verify RLS policies are properly implemented
   - Check role-based access control

2. **Authentication Integration**:
   - Verify user authentication flow with Supabase
   - Check permission models for different user types

## Deliverables

Please provide a comprehensive audit report including:

1. **Completeness Assessment**: 
   - Are all required tables, columns, and relationships implemented?
   - Have all business functions been created?

2. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Do implementations match specifications?
   - Are there any deviations from requirements? If so, are they justified?

3. **Business Logic Validation**:
   - Does the markup manager work correctly?
   - Are financial calculations accurate?
   - Do triggers fire appropriately?

4. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Are there any performance concerns?
   - Recommendations for optimization if needed

5. **Security Analysis**:
   - Is the security model sufficient?
   - Are there any security gaps or vulnerabilities?

6. **Recommendations**:
   - Suggested improvements
   - Any missing elements
   - Best practices not currently implemented

## Testing Queries

Use these sample queries to help with your audit:

```sql
-- Check table existence
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Verify relationships
SELECT 
    tc.table_schema, 
    tc.constraint_name, 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_schema AS foreign_table_schema,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM 
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
    JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
      ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
      AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
    JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
      ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
      AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';

-- Check indexes
SELECT
    t.relname AS table_name,
    i.relname AS index_name,
    a.attname AS column_name
FROM
    pg_class t,
    pg_class i,
    pg_index ix,
    pg_attribute a
WHERE
    t.oid = ix.indrelid
    AND i.oid = ix.indexrelid
    AND a.attrelid = t.oid
    AND a.attnum = ANY(ix.indkey)
    AND t.relkind = 'r'
    AND t.relname NOT LIKE 'pg_%'
ORDER BY
    t.relname,
    i.relname;

-- Test markup calculation
SELECT recalculate_all_markups();
SELECT * FROM vendor_invoices LIMIT 10;

-- Test financial reporting
SELECT get_site_financial_summary((SELECT id FROM sites LIMIT 1));
SELECT * FROM outstanding_partner_billings LIMIT 10;
```

## Timeline

Please complete this audit within 3 days and provide your findings. Your thorough verification will ensure the database implementation meets all requirements and provides a solid foundation for the 10NetZero-FLRTS system.

Thank you for your assistance in validating this critical component.
