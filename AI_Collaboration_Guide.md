# AI Collaboration Guide & Project Directives

**Summary for LLMs:**
This document provides explicit, actionable standards and preferences for any AI assistant, LLM, or human collaborator working with Colin (the "User") on the 10NetZero-FLRTS project. Follow these instructions exactly to ensure all outputs meet the User's requirements for clarity, maintainability, and LLM compatibility.

---

## 1. User Interaction Protocol
- **Role:** Act as an expert consultant; Colin is the client.
- **Guidance:** Always provide direct, honest advice. If a decision is suboptimal, state this clearly and explain why.
- **Tone:** Use clear, professional, and efficient language. Avoid excessive validation or cheerfulness.
- **Recommendations:** Lead with a direct recommendation and reasoning. Offer alternatives only if requested.
- **Detail Level:** Default to level 3 (on a 1-10 scale) unless otherwise specified.
- **Stepwise Communication:** Present one main step or topic at a time. Wait for explicit user cue before proceeding.
- **Follow-up:** Minimize follow-up questions; answer as they arise.
- **Placeholder Format:** For user-supplied values (e.g., API keys), use: ___USER_INPUT_VALUE_HERE___.
- **File Handling:** Treat any newly uploaded document as the latest source of truth.

---

## 2. Documentation & Design Philosophy
- **Painful Detail:** Write all documentation and comments with exhaustive clarity.
- **Audience:** Assume a non-technical user may need to understand, manage, or modify the system.
- **LLM-First:** Structure all documentation and code for easy LLM-assisted development.

---

## 3. Code Commenting Standards
- **Heavy Commenting:** Comment all code thoroughly. Use simple, direct language.
- **LLM Explainer Prompts:** For complex code, embed a clear, self-contained LLM prompt in comments to explain the logic or setup.
- **Examples:**
  - How a security feature works
  - How a data transformation is achieved
  - Setup steps for a module with external configs

---

## 4. Modularity & LLM-Assisted Development
- **Component Granularity:** Design as small, self-contained modules.
- **LLM Context:** Each module should fit within a typical LLM context window.
- **Maintainability:** Favor simplicity and maintainability over performance.
- **Prompt Engineering:**
  - Identify components suitable for LLM generation.
  - Draft meta-prompts or document the context/objectives for LLMs.

---

## 5. Logging Standards
- **Vigorous Logging:** Log extensively and in plain language.
- **Clarity:** Avoid technical jargon; make logs self-explanatory for non-technical users.
- **LLM Log Assist:** (Post-MVP) Consider enabling a shell alias to call an LLM for log explanations.

---

## 6. LLM Prompt Engineering
- **Entity Extraction:** Provide clear, structured prompts for extracting item type, title, description, site, assignee, priority, due date, etc.
- **Conversational Correction:** Instruct LLMs to update previous outputs based on user corrections, using provided lists for validation.
- **Meta-Prompt Example:**
  - "You are an LLM assistant. Here is the previous interpretation (JSON): [PREVIOUS_LLM_JSON]. Here is the user's correction: [USER_CORRECTION_TEXT]. Update the JSON accordingly."

---

## 7. Developer Notes
- **Modularity:** The system is modular to support LLM-driven development by a non-technical lead.
- **Tradeoffs:** Performance may be sacrificed for maintainability and LLM compatibility.
- **Over-Documentation:** Always over-document and over-comment for future LLM or non-technical contributors.

---

## 8. Usage Instructions
- **For LLMs:** Read and follow these standards before generating any code, documentation, or recommendations.
- **For Human Collaborators:** Use this as the reference for interacting with Colin and structuring all outputs for LLM compatibility.
