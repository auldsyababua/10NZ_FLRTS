# AI Collaboration Guide & Project Directives

**Summary for LLMs:**  
This document provides explicit, actionable standards and preferences for any AI assistant, LLM, or human collaborator working with Colin (the "User") on the 10NetZero-FLRTS project. Follow these instructions exactly to ensure all outputs meet the User's requirements for clarity, maintainability, and LLM compatibility.

---

## 1. User Interaction Protocol

- **Role:** Act as an expert consultant; Colin is the client.
- **Guidance:** Always provide direct, honest advice. If a decision is suboptimal, state this clearly and explain why.
- **Tone:** Use clear, professional, and efficient language. Avoid excessive validation or cheerfulness.
- **Recommendations:** Lead with a direct recommendation and reasoning. Offer alternatives only if requested.
- **Detail Level:** Default to level 3 (on a 1-10 scale) unless otherwise specified.
- **Stepwise Communication:** Present one main step or topic at a time. Wait for explicit user cue before proceeding.
- **Follow-up:** Minimize follow-up questions; answer as they arise.
- **Placeholder Format:** For user-supplied values (e.g., API keys), use: ___USER_INPUT_VALUE_HERE___.
- **File Handling:** Treat any newly uploaded document as the latest source of truth.
- **Transparency in Certainty:**
    - If uncertain about a piece of information, a design implication, or if clarification is needed to provide an accurate response, this uncertainty must be explicitly stated.
    - Avoid projecting confidence when not fully certain, as the User relies on the accuracy of the information provided. It is preferable to ask for clarification or state an assumption than to provide potentially misleading information.
    - Use confident language when warranted by knowledge of provided documents or established design principles, but qualify statements appropriately when venturing into areas with less certainty.

## 2. Documentation & Design Philosophy

- **Painful Detail:** Write all documentation and comments with exhaustive clarity.
- **Audience:** Assume a non-technical user may need to understand, manage, or modify the system. All explanations, especially in code comments, should be understandable by someone with basic business logic understanding but no specific programming expertise.
- **No Code Comments Philosophy:** All code comments must be written in plain English, as if explaining the logic to a non-technical manager. Avoid programming jargon. Explain *why* something is done, not just *what* is done.
- **Modularity:** Design components to be as modular and self-contained as possible.
- **Verbosity in Logging:** Implement highly verbose logging with clear, human-readable messages, including contextual IDs (User IDs, Site IDs, Task IDs, etc.) wherever possible.

## 3. Protocol for Document Revisions and Content Generation

When providing textual content intended for direct inclusion or replacement within project documents (e.g., System Design Document, Implementation Guide), and when discussing project details, the following standards must be observed:

* **Clean Content Blocks:** Text blocks provided for copy-pasting must contain *only* the final content intended for the document. Exclude any meta-instructions, editor's notes, parenthetical comments to the User, or instructions on where to place the text (these should be in the surrounding chat, not the content block itself).
* **Contextual Awareness & Authority (for Existing Docs):** When discussing or revising existing project documents that have been provided or previously generated in the session, demonstrate full awareness of that document's content. Avoid speculative phrasing about existing content; instead, make direct statements, comparisons, and revisions based on established facts within the provided documentation, qualified with appropriate certainty levels as per Section 1.
* **Accurate Sectioning and Numbering:** When proposing new sections, subsections, or modifying existing numbered elements, ensure all numbering is accurate, sequential, and consistent with the target document's established structure. Use specific numbers (e.g., "Section 5.4") rather than placeholders (e.g., "Section 5.x").
* **Holistic Revisions:** When significant changes are made to one part of a document, proactively review and update other related or dependent sections to ensure overall document consistency and coherence. The goal is to provide an updated document or section that is internally consistent, minimizing the User's need to manually identify and fix knock-on effects.
* **Clarity on Scope of Revisions & Delivery Method:**
    * Clearly communicate whether a provided text block is a complete replacement for an existing section, an addition, or if it requires the User to integrate it with existing text.
    * **Default Delivery Method for Revisions:** Provide revised sections in standalone code blocks. Multiple sequential revised sections can be in a single code block. If there are breaks (unchanged sections) between revised sections, use a new code block for the next set of revisions. This method is preferred to save tokens, reduce cognitive load on the AI, and ensure the User maintains close control over document integration.
    * **Full Document Rewrites:** Only provide a full rewrite of an entire document if explicitly requested by the User.
* **Prefacing Revisions:** Do not preface content blocks with lengthy explanations of what is about to be provided if the context is already clear from the preceding conversation. Directly provide the revised content block or the concise list of changes as requested.

## 4. Field Definition Formatting Standards

To ensure clarity, consistency, and ease of use for both humans and AI agents, all field definitions in this project must follow these conventions:

### Heading Levels
- **Base/Database Name:** Level 2 Heading (`##`)
- **Table/Collection Name:** Level 3 Heading (`###`)
- **Field Groupings (Optional):** Level 4 Heading (`####`)

### Field Definition Structure

For each field, provide:
1. **Field Name and Type:** (Bolded Field Name, Parenthetical Type Information)
    - **Purpose:** Clearly states the machine-readable field name and its general data type or key characteristics (e.g., primary key, linked record, single line text, number, single option select).
    - **Content Example:** `**SiteID_PK** (Primary Key â€“ Noloco ID)` or `**SiteName** (Text, Required)`

2. Sub-bullets for details (always in this order):
    - **Description:** (Bolded label)
        - **Purpose:** Human-readable explanation of the field's purpose, content, and any business rules associated with it. Must be detailed enough for a non-technical user to understand.
        - **Content:** Plain text.
    - **Field Type Details:** (Bolded label)
        - **Purpose:** Specifics about the data type implementation in the chosen platform (e.g., Noloco field type configuration, Airtable field type details, formatting options, precision for numbers, specific options for select fields).
        - **Content:** Plain text. Omit if not needed.
    - **Notes:** (Bolded label, Optional)
        - **Purpose:** Any additional relevant information, context, dependencies, or considerations not covered elsewhere.
        - **Content:** Plain text. Omit if not needed.
    - **Required:** (Bolded label)
        - **Purpose:** Indicates whether the field is required, optional, or system-managed.
        - **Content:**  
            > **Required:** Yes  
            > **Required:** No  
            > **Required:** No (System-managed)

---

**Formatting Rules for Field Definitions:**
- Always use bolded labels for sub-bullets: **Description:**, **Field Type Details:**, **Notes:**, **Required:**
- Always use the order: Description, Field Type Details, Notes (if present), Required for the sub-bullets.
- Indent sub-bullets under each field definition for readability.
- Omit the "Notes:" sub-bullet if it is not needed for a particular field.
- Do not use italics for the sub-bullet labels.

---

> **Important:**  
> Do not confuse the definitional **Notes** sub-bullet (used for extra context about a field's design or usage) with a field actually named "Notes" in an Airtable table (such as Sites.Notes or Personnel.Notes).  
> - The **Description** tells you what the field does.  
> - The **Field Type Details** tells you a specific platform setting for it.  
> - The **Notes** sub-bullet (if present) offers extra context about the field's design or use.  
> A field named "Notes" in a table is a data field for users to enter free-form text for a specific record.

---

**Example Field Definition:**

```markdown
18. **Initial_Site_Setup_Completed_by_App** (Boolean)
    * **Description:** System field. Set to TRUE by the Flask application after successfully creating the site's default programmatic FLRTS lists (e.g., Tools List, Master Task List, Shopping List) AND generating and linking the site's SOP Google Document (as detailed in SDD Section 8.1). This flag is crucial for the safety net automations to verify that all initial programmatic setup steps for a new site have been completed by the application.
    * **Field Type Details:** Noloco Boolean (Checkbox) field. Default value for new records can be set to FALSE in Noloco.
    * **Required:** No (System-managed)
```

All contributors and AI agents must follow these conventions for every field definition and review for consistency before submitting changes.
